<ins>PART ONE: Directions on Using Webstorm</ins>
1) Apply for a Jetbrains educational license from https://www.jetbrains.com/student/.
2) Next, install Webstorm from the Jetbrains site. 
3) After installing Webstorm, install Git as a local program from https://git-scm.com/downloads. GitHub runs on Git. 
4) Then create a GitHub account on https://github.com/join. 
5) Connect your GitHub account to Webstorm through Webstorm's system preferences. Then select "Version Control", then select "Git", then eneter the path to the git.exe.
6) After, add a GitHub password to Webstorm by selecting "Appearance & Behavior", then select "System Settings", then select "Passwords". Then add a location for the password file.
7) Next, open https://github.com and click the "+" in the top right corner and a drop down menu should appear. Click "New Repository."
8) Then, name the repository, choose to make the repository public, and add a readme.file, then click "Create repository."
9) To create a repository in Webstorm, open Webstorm, select VCS and then import into Version Control.
10) To import a repository from from GitHub, select VCS in Webstorm. Then select Checkout from version control and then select "Git."
11) From there, you can enter the name of the GitHub repository and local path name. 
12) To create a Webstorm file, you must create a new file, then click "HTML." From that menu, choose HTML File and then click "Stylesheet."
13) From there, the "Add Files to Git" menu will open. Click "Add" and this will add the file to a local file system. 
14) You can then commit changes. Add a message to the textbox that says "Commit Message," then click "Commit" at the bottom.
15) Then, you can push this change to a remote repository by clicking "VCS", then "Git", then "Push." Now your file has been updated to GitHub. 

<ins>PART TWO: GitHub Glossary<ins>

**Branch** - A branch is essentially a clone of a repository, in which you can work or experiment on without actually editing the main repository.

**Clone** - A clone is an exact copy of a repository that is saved to your computer.

**Commit** - A commit is a specific changed save that you make to your file. It can be used to keep a log of your commits and information regarding who the commit author is and when the commit was changed. 

**Fetch** - The fetch command is used to download new changes from a repository into a local working branch without having to commit right away. 

**GIT** - A Git is a system that allows you to keep track of your source code history.

**Github** - Github is a platform that allows you to manage your Git repositories. 

**Merge** - To merge means to take commits from one branch and combine them to another branch. A pull request is Github’s way of requesting to merge.

**Merge Conflict** - A merge conflict occurs when merge branches cannot merge due to conflicting commits. 

**Push** - Push allows you to send or transfer your commits from a local repository to a remote repository.

**Pull** - Pull takes the current version of the repository to your own local copy. 

**Remote** - Remote is a version of your repository that is usually stored on a server, such as GitHub.com.

**Repository** - The repository is the entire project and where all of the project’s files and history are stored.
